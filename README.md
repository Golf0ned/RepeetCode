# RepeetCode

A tool (and API) to review completed LeetCode problems. Because I wanted to be able to pull random LeetCode Problems for practice.

## Installation

To install:

1. Clone RepeetCode:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Golf0ned/RepeetCode.git
   cd RepeetCode
   ```

2. Install requirements (with or without your virutal environment of choice):

   ```bash
   [create and activate virtual environment]
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use, activate the virtual environment (if using one) and run `src/runner.py` (exact command may vary):

```bash
[command to activate virtual environment] && python src/runner.py
```

Quit by nuking the terminal, or entering q.
